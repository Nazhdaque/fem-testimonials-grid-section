							did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
							project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
							could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
							experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
							100% recommend! ”</p>
